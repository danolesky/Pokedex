# Thanks for visiting my Pokédex!

This was built using React and Material UI for learning purposes and is not very useful otherwise.

A lot of inspiration for this came from Corey Ogburn's Pokédex found here:

[thepoke.de/x/](https://thepoke.de/x/)

I strongly recommend utilizing his instead if you're looking for actual useful information.

Also a special thanks to the Poké API for providing all the Pokémon data I'd ever need:
